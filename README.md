# Description
This repository contains a C++ program for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar cipher encryption algorithm.
The program provides a user-friendly interface to input messages, specify encryption keys, and perform encryption and decryption operations.
Additionally, it offers features such as case conversion, writing encrypted messages to a file, and reading encrypted messages from a file for decryption.

# Features:
1. Encrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm:
   - Utilizes the Caesar cipher method to transform plaintext messages into ciphertext.
   - Provides a straightforward encryption technique based on shifting characters by a fixed value.

2. Decrypt encrypted messages:
   - Offers functionality to reverse the Caesar cipher encryption process.
   - Enables users to retrieve the original plaintext messages from the ciphertext.

3. Specify custom encryption keys (shift values):
   - Allows users to input their preferred shift values for encryption.
   - Provides flexibility in adjusting the level of security and encryption strength.

4. Convert the case of decrypted messages (uppercase/lowercase):
   - Offers the option to modify the case of the decrypted messages.
   - Enhances readability and usability by allowing users to choose between uppercase and lowercase output.

5. Write encrypted messages to a file:
   - Enables users to save encrypted messages into a file format.
   - Facilitates secure data storage and sharing, ensuring encrypted messages can be easily accessed and transmitted.

6. Read encrypted messages from a file for decryption:
   - Allows users to import encrypted messages from files.
   - Streamlines the decryption process by enabling direct access to encrypted data stored in files.

# Usage:
1. Encryption: Input a message and specify a shift value to encrypt it using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
2. Decryption: Enter an encrypted message along with the corresponding shift value to decrypt it back to its original form.
3. Customization: Optionally choose to convert the case of decrypted messages according to preferences.
4. File Operations: Utilize file I/O functionality to save encrypted messages to files or read encrypted messages from files for decryption.
